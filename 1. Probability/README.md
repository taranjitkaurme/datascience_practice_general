# Probability

Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of different outcomes in various situations. It is used to quantify the chance of a particular event happening.

## Key Aspects of Probability

### Definition
Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, inclusive, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.

### Basic Concepts
- **Experiment**: An action or process that leads to one of several possible outcomes.
- **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment.
- **Event**: A set of outcomes of an experiment to which a probability is assigned.

### Probability Models
There are two main types:
- **Classical Probability**: Assumes that all outcomes of an experiment are equally likely. The probability of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
- **Empirical (or Statistical) Probability**: Based on observations or experiments. It is calculated as the number of times an event occurs divided by the total number of trials or instances.

### Applications
Probability is used in a wide range of fields, including statistics, finance, gambling, science, and engineering. It helps in making predictions, evaluating risks, and making informed decisions under uncertainty.

### Rules of Probability
- **Addition Rule**: For mutually exclusive events, the probability of either event occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.
- **Multiplication Rule**: For independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

### Conditional Probability
The probability of an event given that another event has occurred. This concept is particularly useful in scenarios where the occurrence of one event affects the likelihood of another.

### Bayes' Theorem
A way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. This theorem is particularly useful in fields like medical testing, finance, and machine learning.

Probability is a fundamental concept in many aspects of daily life, aiding in making predictions and understanding the likelihood of various events.
